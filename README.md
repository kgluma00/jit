# jit
Just in Time - timekeeping system

Installation is quite simple (for now I guess).

Step 1) all files in LIBS folder inside JIT.MVC copy/paste into C:\Program Files\IIS Express

Step 2) Write "update-database" using Package Manager Console. If it doesn't work, add-migration first and set JIT.MVC as startup project!

Enjoy
